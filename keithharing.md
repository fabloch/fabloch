The mission of the Keith Haring Foundation is to sustain, expand, and protect
the legacy of Keith Haring, his art, and his ideals. The Foundation supports
not-for-profit organizations that assist children, as well as organizations
involved in education, research and care related to AIDS.

Keith Haring (1958-1990) generously contributed his talents and resources to
numerous causes. He conducted art workshops with children, created logos and
posters for public service agencies, and produced murals, sculptures, and
paintings to benefit health centers and disadvantaged communities. In 1989,
Keith established a foundation to ensure that his philanthropic legacy would
continue indefinitely.

The Keith Haring Foundation makes grants to not-for-profit groups that engage in
charitable and educational activities. In accordance with Keith’s wishes, the
Foundation concentrates its giving in two areas: The support of organizations
which provide educational opportunities to underprivileged children and the
support of organizations which engage in education, prevention and care with
respect to AIDS and HIV infection.

Keith Haring additionally charged the Foundation with maintaining and protecting
his artistic legacy after his death. The Foundation maintains a collection of
art along with archives that facilitate historical research about the artist and
the times and places in which he lived and worked. The Foundation supports arts
and educational institutions by funding exhibitions, educational programs, and
publications that serve to contextualize and illuminate the artist’s work and
philosophy.
